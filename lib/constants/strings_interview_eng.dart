    'Each of us has to go through more than one interview in our lifetime before we can find a job,'
        'which will fully meet the needs and expectations and which suits you. '
        'Often the reason for a long job search is the high competition in the labor market and the fact that '
        'that the supply greatly exceeds the demand. Therefore, it is important to be able to "sell" yourself as a specialist, especially for those'
        'whose job involves regular communication with clients. ',
    'Due to the fact that the number of jobseekers who are looking for a job is greater,'
        'than vacancies regardless of industry or position, recruiters, '
        'forced to come up with more and more sophisticated questions so that even in the early stages '
        '(telephone interview, interview with the recruiting manager) weed out weak candidates. '
        'Therefore, further our recruitment agency proposes to consider the most difficult questions for job seekers,'
        'but informative for the interviewer.',
    'A common first question for hiring managers/executives is to tell about yourself. '
        'Often a person is lost, because he does not know what they want to hear from him, but this question requires you to only briefly, '
        'but succinct help about the following: ',
    'Your education, graduation year.',
    'Your work experience.',
    'The emphasis in job descriptions is on those companies and positions,'
        'which fully or to a greater extent correspond to the position for which you are applying in this company. '
        'At the same time, you are required to outline the scope of your duties and, if possible, achievements. '
        'If there is a lot of such experience, obtained in different companies, then tell us about the last two or three places of work, or about those,'
        'Where did you work the longest. Information about other positions, companies can be given, but in the abstract or in the case, '
        'if you have little profile experience.',
    'Information regarding career progression is also given in brief if the interviewer has any '
        'questions or interest in a specific experience / place of work, he will ask you to give a detailed answer. '
        'Try to describe work experience based on the duties that you have to perform at a new job,'
        'those. reformulate the responsibilities indicated in the job description, correlating with your experience.',
    'At the end of the presentation of your experience, you can explain the reasons for looking for a job at the moment. '
        'If you have a feeling that the employer wants to hear something else from you, and you have already told everything,'
        'something good to say about your hobby.',
    'Having received a brief and concise answer to a request to tell about yourself, the manager then asks questions, '
        'which relate to the most significant knowledge, skills, abilities to perform specific professional tasks. '
        'Increasingly, recruiting managers are using case studies to clarify the experience of solving labor problems,'
        'that is, they simulate a working situation, look at the reaction, draw conclusions.',
    'Reasons for leaving your previous job?',
    'The selection specialist needs to understand what did not suit you in the previous place and what you expect from the new job. '
        'Important! Do not speak badly about your former management, colleagues, as this is ugly and causes suspicion of your abilities '
        'Establish relationships with the team. The most acceptable would be to say that you were not satisfied with the work schedule, '
        'territorial location, the work was of a routine nature, there were no prospects for professional and career development. '
        'In this case, it is better to choose one or two factors that will be true and not present in the new company.',
    'The last thing to talk about is the desire to earn more, making it clear to a potential employer,'
        'that money is not the most important thing in the job. However, if you are a sales manager, it is acceptable to put the emphasis first on '
        'on the opportunity to get more, since your main task is to bring as much money to the company as possible. '
        'The lack of opportunities in the previous company to increase sales turnover and thereby their income - for many managers '
        'is a good reason to change jobs.',
    'While completing this question, in order to remove any doubts from the hiring manager about your competence, '
        'professionalism, non-conflict, etc. say that you are ready to provide recommendations from the last places of work '
        'from immediate supervisors, BUT be sure that the recommendations will be really positive!',
    'What are your salary expectations?'
        'Sufficiently successful is the answer that wages should correspond to the duties that will be entrusted to you. '
        'However, a potential employer must understand find out if he can provide you with the income you are claiming. '
        'Therefore, you can designate the income at the last place of work as the minimum, and the desired one is higher by 20-30%. '
        'But keep in mind that your expectations should not be significantly higher than the amount that the new company can provide.',
    'Tell me about your shortcomings?',
    'All people and everyone has flaws. It is not worth answering this question honestly, it is best to evade the answer, '
        'by saying that you have no flaws that will interfere with your work. Or you can laugh it off by saying that for '
        'Sometimes it\'s common for you to lose time by getting carried away with work.',
    'What achievements did you have in your previous job?',
    'This question requires from you again a short but capacious answer. Tell us about the successful implementation of the project, '
        'brought a major customer, increased sales, etc. You can back up your answer with an illustration of your biggest accomplishment, '
        'for example, after successfully negotiating with client "N", you managed to conclude an agreement on the sale of goods for the amount of "X", '
        'which has never been done before by any of the employees.',
    'How do you feel about high-intensity work, overtime?;',
    'First, clarify what exactly is meant by this question. Will you have to sit until midnight or work alone '
        'for the whole department? If the answer and conditions are acceptable to you, then say that you had experience in similar conditions, '
        'and managed successfully.',
    'What do you know about our company and what do you expect from work?',
    'If you go for an interview directly to the employer, you must look at information about him in advance: '
        'what the company does, how long it\'s been in the market, benefits, etc.'
        'Finding information in advance will not only help you successfully pass '
        'interview, but also in some cases do not take the time to travel to an unscrupulous employer. '
        'Expectations that you voice should be consistent with the opportunities that the company can provide, ie. '
        'You are expected to fulfill your potential by fulfilling the responsibilities of the respective positions in this company.',
    'How long do you expect to work for this company?',
    'Of course, you expect to work in the company as long as possible. Expect to be able to '
        'develop professionally and, if the position implies it, grow up the career ladder. At the same time, you understand'
        'that it is also necessary to get to know the team and the company from the inside, to understand in practice how feasible and interesting '
        'set tasks before saying that you are ready to work for the company for a long period of time.',
    'What made you interested in working in this particular company?',
    'It is appropriate to say about the stability of the company, its reliability, fame, the proposed prospects for growth and development of employees,'
        'interesting area of work and tasks, proposed conditions. You can name several criteria, '
        'the main thing is not to forget that they must correspond to reality.',
    'You need to remember when talking with a manager/recruiter that all their questions are aimed at identifying the best '
        'a specialist who is ready for a long and fruitful cooperation. In addition, you, as a potential employee, too '
        'you can get information about your future employer by analyzing questions.',
    'So if you are asked a lot of serious questions about your knowledge and skills, then when you get a job in this organization, '
        'You will find yourself among professionals. If the interview pays due attention to you as a person, then the company is good '
        'socio-psychological climate, etc. At the end of the conversation, it is appropriate and reasonable to ask your questions, thereby you will show, '
        'who are interested in the job, being careful when choosing a future employer, and asking questions about the nuances of the job,'
        'you can additionally emphasize qualifications.',
    'In conclusion, I want to give some universal recommendations to applicants, they are especially useful for those who do not have experience '
        'passing interviews and those who have it negative.',
    'Recruiters and executives favor proactive,'
        'interested and motivated candidates. So don\'t wait to be asked a specific question'
        ' on every aspect of your job, don\'t make the interviewer pull information from you - it always produces '
        'negative impression!',
    'If you are very worried, say so, thus you will create a small pause in the flow of questions, '
        'the situation will calm down a little, and you will be able to collect your thoughts and continue the conversation.',
    'Listen carefully to the question that you are asked (whether in person or at the stage of another telephone conversation). '
        'Not consistency, randomness of answers and inattention of the applicant often become the reasons why '
        'that after a few minutes of talking on the phone they are no longer ready to consider you for a particular position. '
        'If you misheard - ask again, the essence of the question is not clear - reformulate and clarify whether it is correct '
        'You understand what they want to hear from you.',
    'In conversation, be attentive and friendly, and when answering, be logical, specific and understandable.'

    'Someone goes to an interview easily, guided by the principle "as it will be, so it will be." '
        'Many perceive the interview with a recruiter as one of the most important exams on which the whole future life depends. '
        'Be that as it may, since you are going to an interview, it means that you are not indifferent to its result.',
    'Therefore, it would be a good idea to prepare for the upcoming interview. Before going to an interview with a recruiting agency, '
        'find out the most common questions recruiters ask.',
    '1. Could you tell about yourself?',
    'The main thing when answering is to maintain a balance of business and personal information. Emphasis should be placed on your work experience,'
        ' education received, casually mention achievements (in passing - because you will still be allowed to speak out on this topic). '
        'You can refuse to reveal yourself from a non-professional side, but if you tell a little about your hobbies, it will be a plus. '
        'Especially if hobbies contribute to self-development. For example, you love hockey and regularly translate overseas press in '
        'Your own personal blog about the Boston Bruins is easy to pass under the sauce of \'English perfection\'. Do you read modern literature? '
        'Great, following trends in different areas of life is a useful quality for any candidate.',
    '2. What are your shortcomings and weaknesses?',
    'The case when an honest answer will lower your points. Other applicants for the vacancy also have disadvantages, '
        'and if they don\'t talk about their own, and you show integrity, then nothing good will happen. The candidate told,'
        ' which is a bit unpunctual. Considering his qualifications - forgivable. But maybe the purpose of the answer is to divert attention from others, '
        'Where are the more serious shortcomings? It’s not just that he easily admitted that he was regularly late, ”alas, '
        'many recruiters would think that way.',
    'Therefore, answer in the style of "My shortcomings have a serious advantage: they do not affect work performance in any way."',
    'Our advice is to admit to a handicap that is not very significant for the position you are applying for. If the accountant says, '
        'that he can\'t call himself the \'life of the company\' at work and is not very verbose and will easily be forgiven for that.',
    '3. What were your achievements at your last job?',
    'It\'s not bad if you really had serious achievements. But even very cool specialists should not '
        'indulge in a lengthy narrative, similar to the retelling of the myths about Hercules. Highlight the main - modest, '
        'but self-aware candidates are highly rated.',
    'Employers like to achieve in numbers, so you can say that at the last place of work they exceeded the plan 3 times on '
        '20% and it will be very significant.',
    'No special achievements? It doesn\'t matter, dig into your memory: the options "improved my professional skills", '
        '\'mastered a useful program\' is better than nothing.',
    '4. Why did you leave your previous employer?',
    'It is unacceptable to blame bad relations with colleagues and superiors - you will certainly be mistaken for a conflict person. '
        'Poor career prospects are a good reason, but only if in a new job'
        'these prospects will improve. A valid reason for dismissal is the relocation of the company\'s office to another area '
        'city or many months of salary delays. Otherwise, it\'s best to tell the truth. The money issue is worth mentioning,'
        'but preferably at the very end of the answer.',
    '5. What salary will suit you?',
    'Moving to a new job with a pay cut is nonsense. Therefore, even if the change of employer is in any way '
        'is not related to your money requests, it is worth giving a figure higher than your previous salary. '
        'Ideally, by ten or fifteen percent.',
    '6. How do you see your professional future in five years?',
    'A very unpleasant question for those who plan to change their field of activity in the coming years'
        'or, having serious ambitions, counts on a lightning-fast promotion. '
        'If there are no concrete thoughts about the professional future, it is also difficult to answer.',
    'You should proceed from what the personnel officer wants to hear. And he will surely be satisfied with the answer, '
        'that you plan to work in the same field, although you will not refuse to help the company at a higher career level.',
    '7. What have you heard about our company?',
    'It\'s simple here. Read about the new employer, take a look at his website. Option I haven\'t heard much and I don\'t know'
        'I just need a bigger salary - fail.',
    '8. Why did you decide to work in our company?',
    'Talk a little about their pluses. "Becoming an important element in your system, the industry leader system, is my priority,'
        ' "you will give me stability - what I dwaited a long time." It will be great to supplement the main story with household trifles: '
        'I\'ve been wanting to rent an apartment in the next block for a long time: the infrastructure is good there.',
    'Money, important as it is, should appear at the end of the answer: "Besides, '
        'a little pay raise won\'t hurt me.',
    '9. How long have you come to us?',
    'It\'s tempting to say that you plan to work for such a great company for at least the next seven years,'
        'but take your time. Such an answer looks insincere and can spoil the impression of the interview.',
    'Optimal: "I would like to work longer, but a lot depends on whether I can successfully solve '
        'the tasks set, will I be able to realize my potential, will I fit into the team.',
    '10. Are you able to withstand heavy loads, do you agree to processing?',
    'It is worth clarifying how often processing takes place, how long they take. If you\'re being planned'
        'often borrow after hours - check if overtime is paid. And based on these facts build your answer.'

    'When writing a resume, you naturally try to show yourself in the best light. '
        'So that the future employer is seriously interested in such an employee. And the recruiting agency postponed '
        'your folder in a stack marked "Most Promising"?',
    'By reviewing a huge number of resumes, we were able to identify six of the most common job applicant mistakes. '
        'Get familiar with them so that your resume is perfect!',
    '1. Sloppy, unread text',
    'Missing commas, incorrect use of punctuation marks, misspellings is the best way to show '
        'that you do not care about the vacancy, in general, no. It doesn\'t matter at all'
        'do you need to show knowledge of punctuation, spelling and style in the workplace. '
        'The thing is, a resume is your face, your suit, your everything. '
        'Yes, the main thing is to do your job well. But the position must first be won, '
        'and if earlier the applicant was met "by clothes", now, in the era of information technology, they are met by resume. '
        'Just imagine that a person comes to an interview in wrinkled pajamas. Would you trust him with a serious position? We don\'t think.',
    'Another example. You go to an online store and see that it sells Ipone, Sasung, Nokia smartphones. '
        'Will such a seller be trusted? If he checked the texts badly, then for sure and '
        'he treats his other duties negligently, right?',
    'Be sure to carefully read everything that you send to the employer. '
        'If correct Russian is your problem, let a philologist friend help you. '
        'In a pinch, you can always find an inexpensive proofreader or use Word\'s spell checker.',
    '2. Inappropriate photo',
    'A photo on a resume is cool. You show that you have nothing to hide: here I have told about my skills and experience, '
        'and here I am, I will be glad to work in a good company. It\'s captivating.',
    'But it doesn\'t have to be a photo of a beach in a bathing suit or of a friendly drinking party, a photo of a playful expression or an unambiguous pose. '
        'Most often girls send inappropriate photos.',
    'It is worth remembering that the ideal photograph is a suit close to the classic, not tense, but not cheeky pose. '
        'And yes, you need to be photographed in full face. A bikini or shorts - only for those who are casting in a modeling agency.',
    '3. Contacts',
    'The employer is interested in the resume, wants to discuss the terms of the future cooperation, dials the phone number.... '
        'An amazing fact: at this stage, too many candidates are eliminated. A person does not get the desired job simply because '
        'It\'s hard to get through to him. Two or three attempts and the candidate is eliminated.',
    'Such embarrassment is easy to avoid: just write the time at which it is convenient for you to receive calls and leave your e-mail. '
        'The e-mail address should not be frivolous: SmeshnoyGus11, nimfetka777, ILoveSex666 are extremely unfortunate options. '
        'Get an address with a solid name. And don\'t forget to check your mail every day.',
    '4. Misplaced information',
    'At this point, most of the problems occur when specifying education and experience. Fish training courses will not help in the work of an accountant. '
        'A solid coaching experience in swamp football is not good for a law firm.',
    'It is worth writing only about the experience that you somehow can be useful in a new workplace. '
        'You certainly have something to brag about outside the professional sphere, but take care of the man,'
        'who will fish out the necessary information from the sea of information. And remember: if the sea is too big, it may get bored with the process.',
    'Important data is also desirable to submit concisely. Of course, two or three pages of your skills and achievements is solid. '
        'But if you talk about the main thing briefly at the very beginning of the resume, the impression will be even stronger. The ideal format is one page.',
    '5. Vague information',
    'Writes, for example, the applicant Ivanov Ivan Ivanovich: "Seven years of work in leadership positions." '
        'The question arises: why no specifics? Maybe Ivanov changed jobs many times? Or the company is not listed because '
        'that the applicant has left a bad memory of himself? The more vague the information, the greater the distrust of the employer.',
    'The more concrete the facts, the better. The line "Worked for Generation C for seven years as director of marketing"'
        'does not cause unnecessary doubts and negates the possibility of negative interpretations. '
        'The size of the company, its scope of activity is also important information for many positions (from accountants to management). '
        'Employers love it when CVs show measurable accomplishments.',
    '6. Bogatyrsky swing',
    'I apply for the positions of senior manager, manager and sales director m" - this can be written, '
        'Only when you want to hurt yourself. The message is clear: the applicant wants to be a director, but if he is offered a managerial position, '
        'he will not refuse, because the work is needed here and now. But rarely does a company need a director, '
        'whose ambitions are also satisfied by another position.',
    'The situation is different: you are qualified and versatile enough to apply for several positions,'
        'who are not subordinate to each other. For example, you enjoy designing, but you can also work as a copywriter. '
        'It\'s okay, but it\'s worth breaking your resume apart so that design and copywriting don\'t get confused.'
